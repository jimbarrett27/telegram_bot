# The Goblin Caves of Thornwood

A short adventure for a party of 1st-3rd level characters. The village of Bramblewood needs heroes to track down a goblin raiding party and rescue a kidnapped child.

## Adventure Setup

The village of Bramblewood has been plagued by goblin raids for weeks. Livestock has gone missing, caravans have been ambushed, and last night a child was taken. The village elder, a weathered woman named Marta, has posted a bounty for any adventurers brave enough to track the goblins back to their lair and put an end to the threat.

The trail leads into Thornwood Forest, a dense woodland where the canopy blocks most sunlight. After hours of tracking, the party discovers a cave entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The air smells of smoke and rotting meat.

## Cast of Characters

- **Marta** — Village elder of Bramblewood. Weathered and pragmatic, she offers 50 gold for the safe return of the child.
- **Finn** — The kidnapped child, age 8. Brave but frightened.
- **Grukk** — A dwarf merchant captured by the goblins a week ago. Will offer a reward if rescued.
- **Chieftain Skragga** — The goblin chieftain who sits on a throne of bones. Wears a mysterious amulet that glows with dark energy.
- **Brug** — Skragga's bugbear bodyguard. Loyal and dangerous.

## Scene 1: The Entrance Hall

A wide cavern with crude goblin graffiti on the walls. Two tunnels lead deeper into the caves — one to the left and one to the right. Two goblin sentries guard the entrance, but they are distracted by a game of knucklebones.

**Encounters:**
- 2 goblin sentries (may be surprised if the party is stealthy)

**Trap:** The left tunnel contains a pit trap covered with leaves and twigs. A DC 12 Perception check spots it; DC 14 Dexterity save to avoid falling (1d6 damage).

## Scene 2: The Mushroom Grotto

A side cavern filled with glowing fungi in blues and greens. Some mushrooms are edible and mildly restorative (1d4 HP if consumed), while others are poisonous (DC 12 Constitution save or 1d6 poison damage). A DC 13 Nature check identifies which are safe.

The grotto is otherwise peaceful — a good place to rest, but goblin patrols pass nearby every hour.

## Scene 3: The Prison Cells

Rough-hewn cells with rusty iron bars. Finn the child and Grukk the dwarf merchant are held here, guarded by a single goblin jailer who is half-asleep.

**Encounters:**
- 1 goblin jailer (may be surprised)

**Rescue:** The cell locks can be picked (DC 13 Thieves' Tools) or the key taken from the jailer. Finn is frightened but unharmed. Grukk offers his thanks and promises to reward the party when they return to civilization.

## Scene 4: The Goblin Barracks

A large, foul-smelling room where goblin warriors rest between raids. Crude bedrolls, stolen goods, and half-eaten food litter the floor. The goblins here are off-duty but will fight if alerted.

**Encounters:**
- 6-8 goblins (number depends on how many the party has already defeated)

**Tactics:** Goblins are cowardly — if half their number fall, survivors attempt to flee toward the Chieftain's Chamber to warn Skragga.

**Treasure:** Stolen trade goods worth 25 gold, a potion of healing, and a silver dagger.

## Scene 5: The Chieftain's Chamber

Chieftain Skragga sits on a throne of bones at the back of a large cavern. His bugbear bodyguard Brug stands beside him. The amulet around Skragga's neck pulses with an eerie dark light.

**Encounters:**
- Chieftain Skragga (goblin boss, enhanced by the amulet)
- Brug the bugbear bodyguard

**Tactics:** Skragga commands from his throne while Brug charges into melee. If Skragga is reduced to half HP, he attempts to flee through a hidden door behind the throne.

**The Amulet:** The amulet has been corrupting Skragga, making the goblins far more aggressive than usual. It radiates dark necromantic energy. Removing or destroying it causes Skragga to cower and any remaining goblins to scatter.

## Scene 6: The Hidden Shrine

Behind a secret door in the Chieftain's Chamber (DC 15 Investigation to find, or automatically discovered if Skragga flees through it) lies a small shrine to a dark entity. Dark candles burn with purple flame around a crude stone altar.

The amulet is the key to the shrine. Placing it on the altar and destroying it (DC 10 Strength or any magical attack) causes the dark energy to dissipate. The remaining goblins in the cave system lose their aggression and scatter into the wilderness.

**Alternative:** A DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the shrine could be repurposed or the amulet kept — but warns of the corruption risk.

## Epilogue

With the goblins defeated or scattered and the captives rescued, the party can return to Bramblewood as heroes.

**Rewards:**
- 50 gold from Marta for rescuing Finn
- 25 gold and a favor from Grukk the dwarf merchant
- Stolen goods recovered from the barracks (25 gold value)
- The chieftain's amulet (cursed, but potentially valuable to the right buyer)
- The gratitude of Bramblewood — free room and board whenever passing through

**Notes for DM:**
- Creative solutions (sneaking, diplomacy with frightened goblins) should be rewarded with XP and advantage
- The amulet's dark entity could serve as a hook for future adventures
- If the party spares Skragga after removing the amulet, the humbled goblin may become an unlikely ally later
