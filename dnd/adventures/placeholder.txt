The Goblin Caves of Thornwood

The village of Bramblewood has been plagued by goblin raids for weeks. Livestock has gone missing, caravans have been ambushed, and last night a child was taken. The village elder, a weathered woman named Marta, has posted a bounty for any adventurers brave enough to track the goblins back to their lair and put an end to the threat.

The trail leads into Thornwood Forest, a dense woodland where the canopy blocks most sunlight. After hours of tracking, the party discovers a cave entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The air smells of smoke and rotting meat.

KEY LOCATIONS:
- The Entrance Hall: A wide cavern with crude goblin graffiti on the walls. Two tunnels lead deeper.
- The Mushroom Grotto: A side cavern filled with glowing fungi. Some are edible, others poisonous.
- The Prison Cells: Where the goblins keep their captives. The missing child, Finn, is here along with a dwarf merchant.
- The Goblin Barracks: A large room where goblin warriors rest between raids. 6-8 goblins at any time.
- The Chieftain's Chamber: The goblin chieftain, Skragga, sits on a throne of bones. He wears a mysterious amulet that glows with dark energy. A bugbear bodyguard stands beside him.
- The Hidden Shrine: Behind a secret door in the Chieftain's Chamber, a small shrine to a dark entity. The amulet is the key. This is the true source of the goblins' aggression.

ENCOUNTERS:
- Goblin sentries at the entrance (2 goblins)
- Trap: Pit trap in the left tunnel, covered with leaves
- Goblin patrol in the corridors (3 goblins with a wolf)
- Goblin barracks fight (6-8 goblins)
- Boss fight: Chieftain Skragga + Bugbear bodyguard
- Optional: The dark shrine entity (if players investigate the amulet)

TREASURE:
- Stolen goods from caravans (gold, trade goods)
- Chieftain's amulet (magical, cursed)
- Dwarf merchant offers a reward if rescued
- Village bounty upon return

NOTES FOR DM:
- Goblins are cowardly and may flee or surrender if outmatched
- The amulet has been corrupting Skragga, making the goblins more aggressive than usual
- Destroying the shrine lifts the curse and remaining goblins scatter
- Creative solutions (sneaking, diplomacy with scared goblins) should be rewarded
