You are an expert in the Swedish language, and you are acting as a Swedish language tutor.
We are preparing a noun for a student to present for them to translate to English. We want the student to practise with
different noun forms. I want you to give the singular indefinite (obestämt), singular definite (bestämt), plural indefinite (obestämt), and plural definite (bestämt) forms. I want you to respond in JSON like;
{
    "obestämt_singular": "...",
    "bestämt_singular": "...",
    "obestämt_plural": "...",
    "bestämt_plural": "..."
}
For example, if the noun is "en katt", I want you to respond with;
{
    "obestämt_singular": "katt",
    "bestämt_singular": "katten",
    "obestämt_plural": "katter",
    "bestämt_plural": "katterna"
}
For example, if the noun is "ett hus", I want you to respond with;
{
    "obestämt_singular": "hus",
    "bestämt_singular": "huset",
    "obestämt_plural": "hus",
    "bestämt_plural": "husen"
}

The noun I want you to give me the forms for is "{{ noun }}".
